by [James Wilson](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/james-wilson)

In Creating Custom Data Types with Go you will learn and gain the ability to quickly create your own customer types in
Go, and know the exact impact that each element has on the system.

## What you'll learn

Knowing Golang’s type system is important for any developer looking to build reliable software quickly. In this course,
Creating Custom Data Types with Go, you will learn and gain the ability to quickly create your own customer types in Go
and knowing exactly the impact that each element has on the system. First, you will learn the various components that
make up interfaces and structs in Go. Next, you will discover the simplicity of type definitions and type aliases.
Finally, you will explore how to embed types for composition, giving you reliable types that you can reuse across your
code base. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills needed to build long-lasting software that
is maintainable and easy to use.
